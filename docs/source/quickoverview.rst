Quick Overview
==============

SCRIBE (Single-Cell RNA-Seq Inference using Bayesian Estimation) takes a
fundamentally different approach to single-cell RNA sequencing analysis. Instead
of treating cells as isolated data points that need to be normalized,
batch-corrected, and processed, SCRIBE views each cell as a sample from a
statistical model that describes the entire dataset.

The Power of Probabilistic Modeling
-----------------------------------

At its core, SCRIBE embraces the inherent uncertainty in scRNA-seq data through
Bayesian modeling. Consider a typical dataset with 10,000 cells and 20,000 genes
â€”that's 200 million data points! Rather than making point estimates about
expression levels, SCRIBE learns probability distributions that capture:

* How variable each gene's expression truly is
* Which zeros represent technical dropouts versus biological absence
* How capture efficiency varies between cells
* Whether cells belong to distinct subpopulations

   Rather than single values, SCRIBE learns complete probability distributions 
   for model parameters. Here, the posterior distribution for the success 
   probability parameter shows the range of plausible values given the data.

A Unified Framework for Inference
---------------------------------

With high-dimensional data, no single inference method is perfect. SCRIBE
provides three powerful, complementary methods accessible through a single,
unified interface:

* **Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI)**: An optimization-based method that
  is extremely fast and scalable, perfect for exploring large datasets quickly.
* **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)**: A sampling-based method that provides the
  gold-standard, exact posterior distribution for rigorous, publication-quality
  analysis. This requires specialized hardware such as GPUs with double
  precision support and a lot of memory (e.g., NVIDIA H100).
* **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)**: A deep learning approach that combines
  fast inference with powerful representation learning, ideal for tasks like
  dimensionality reduction and discovering latent structure.

This unified framework allows you to easily switch between speed and accuracy,
choosing the right tool for the right stage of your analysis.

What Can You Do with SCRIBE?
----------------------------

Once SCRIBE learns your model, you can:

* Generate normalized expression values with principled uncertainty estimates
* Identify technical artifacts and batch effects probabilistically
* Find cell subpopulations without arbitrary clustering
* Make predictions about new cells
* Compare different models to understand your data's structure

   SCRIBE can generate synthetic data (blue bands) that matches the statistical 
   properties of your real data (black line), allowing you to validate model fit
   and make predictions.

The Bayesian Advantage
----------------------

The Bayesian framework provides several key benefits for single-cell analysis:

* **Specialized Models**: Choose from models tailored to scRNA-seq data, such as
  the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) and models that account for
  Variable Capture Probability (VCP).
* **Uncertainty Quantification**: Every estimate comes with credible regions.
* **Model Comparison**: Rigorously choose between competing biological
  hypotheses.
* **Principled Handling of Zeros**: Distinguish between technical dropouts and
  true biological absence.
* **Integration**: A natural framework for combining data from multiple
  experiments (to be developed).
* **Prediction**: Generate realistic synthetic data for model validation.

SCRIBE makes these powerful Bayesian methods accessible through a simple Python
interface, while maintaining the mathematical rigor necessary for proper
statistical inference. Whether you're interested in basic normalization or
complex mixture modeling, SCRIBE provides a principled foundation for your
single-cell analysis.
