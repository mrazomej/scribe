SCRIBE Examples Gallery
=======================

This gallery contains comprehensive examples demonstrating how to use SCRIBE for
single-cell RNA-seq analysis. These tutorials cover everything from basic model
fitting to advanced diagnostics and model comparison.

SCRIBE (Single-Cell Robust Inference via Bayesian Estimation) provides
principled Bayesian models for analyzing single-cell count data, with particular
emphasis on handling the technical challenges of single-cell sequencing such as
dropout events and variable capture efficiency.
