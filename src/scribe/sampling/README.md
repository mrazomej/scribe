# SCRIBE Sampling

Posterior sampling, predictive checks, and Bayesian denoising utilities.

## Overview

This package provides the sampling layer for SCRIBE, covering three main
workflows:

1. **Predictive sampling** — draw from variational/prior predictive
   distributions via NumPyro's `Predictive`.
2. **Posterior predictive checks (PPC)** — generate replicate count data
   from posterior parameter estimates, either using the full generative model
   (NB / ZINB / VCP / BNB / mixtures) or using only the biological NB
   component (stripping capture efficiency and zero-inflation).
3. **Bayesian denoising** — compute the posterior of the true (pre-capture,
   pre-dropout) transcript counts given observed UMI counts and posterior
   parameter estimates. The NB/BNB family uses closed-form Poisson–Gamma
   conjugacy; the Two-State (Poisson–Beta) family uses Gauss–Legendre
   quadrature over the latent promoter ON-fraction.

### Internal Dependencies

```
_predictive.py           → _helpers.py
_biological_ppc.py       → _helpers.py
_posterior_ppc.py        → _helpers.py
_denoising.py            → _helpers.py, _denoising_bnb.py, _denoising_twostate.py
```

All public and underscore names used by external code are re-exported from
`__init__.py`, so every existing `from scribe.sampling import X` continues
to work unchanged.

## Parameterization Convention

Throughout this package the canonical `p` follows the **numpyro convention**:
it is the `probs` argument of `NegativeBinomialProbs`, i.e. the probability
of each Bernoulli trial producing a count.  The NB mean is therefore
`r * p / (1 - p)`.  This is the *complement* of the paper's p (which
appears as p^r in the PMF).

## GPU Performance Optimizations

### PPC MAP Path — `vmap` over RNG Keys

The MAP (non-sample-dimension) path in both `sample_biological_nb` and
`sample_posterior_ppc` replaces a Python `for` loop over `n_samples` with
`jax.vmap`.  Since MAP parameters are constant across draws, only the PRNG key
varies per sample; the wrapper captures all other arguments and passes
`cell_batch_size=None` to let XLA fuse the full cell dimension into a single
kernel.

When `n_samples` is large enough to exceed GPU memory, the vmap call is chunked
using `_vmap_chunk_size` from `core._array_dispatch`, which queries available
device memory at runtime and splits the batch automatically.

### Denoising — `vmap` over Posterior Draws

`denoise_counts` uses the same vmap + adaptive-chunking pattern for its
multi-sample (posterior) path.  Each posterior draw's parameters are mapped via
`in_axes` based on `AxisLayout` metadata (with a runtime guard that verifies
axis-0 size matches `n_samples`, protecting against the deprecated
layout-inference path which can over-report sample dims). `cell_batch_size=None`
is passed to `_denoise_single` so XLA fuses the full cell dimension, while
memory is managed by chunking the sample axis.  `return_variance=True` is always
used inside the vmap closure to ensure a consistent return signature; the
variance array is discarded when the caller did not request it.

## Integration

- **SVI / MCMC results objects** call into this package for PPC, biological
  PPC, and denoising.  They always provide `param_layouts` (AxisLayout
  metadata), so the deprecated shape-heuristic fallback paths are never hit
  in normal use.
- **`core.axis_layout`** provides `AxisLayout`, `build_sample_layouts`, and
  `derive_axis_membership`, used by `_helpers.py` to build layouts from
  `ModelConfig`.
- **`models.components.likelihoods.beta_negative_binomial`** provides
  `build_count_dist`, used by PPC and denoising to construct the
  appropriate NB/BNB distribution objects.
- **`models.components.likelihoods.two_state`** provides
  `_twostate_dispatch_reparam`, used by the SVI denoising mixin to
  convert posterior parameter samples into `(α, β, r̂)` for the
  Two-State quadrature denoiser.

## VAE Replay Modes and Parameter Binding

For VAE-backed models, replay must always receive the trained parameter
dictionary so `numpyro.param` / `flax_module` sites are substituted during
`Predictive` calls.

- `sample_variational_posterior` passes `params` to both the guide and
  model-replay `Predictive` steps.
- `generate_predictive_samples` accepts optional `params` and forwards
  them to `Predictive`.

Without this wiring, decoder parameters (e.g. `vae_decoder$params`) can
be re-initialized during replay, producing incorrect predictive samples.

`ScribeVAEResults.get_posterior_samples()` supports two replay modes:

1. **Encoder path (`counts` provided)**: sample from `q(z|counts)` via the
   VAE guide, then replay the model with substituted trained params.
2. **Prior path (`counts=None`)**: bypass the guide and sample `z` directly
   from the model prior while replaying with substituted trained params.
   - For LNM/LNMVCP this is the expected population-sampling behavior.
   - For VAEs with a latent flow prior, `z` is sampled from the learned
     flow prior (`FlowDistribution(flow, N(0, I))`).
   - For non-LNM VAEs without a flow prior, SCRIBE emits a warning that
     `z` is sampled from the uninformative `N(0, I)` prior.
