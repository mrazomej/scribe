# Markov Chain Monte Carlo configuration

method: mcmc

# Number of MCMC samples to draw
n_samples: 2_000

# Number of warmup samples
n_warmup: 1_000

# Number of parallel chains
n_chains: 1

# Run in float64 (double) precision
# NUTS Hamiltonian dynamics benefit from double precision for numerical
# stability during leapfrog integration and mass-matrix adaptation.
# Set to false to use float32 (faster but may cause divergent transitions).
