# Low-Rank Logistic-Normal Approximation for Normalized Expression
{#sec-normalization}

In @sec-dirichlet-multinomial, we derived the Dirichlet-Multinomial model for
single-cell RNA-seq data, showing that the joint distribution of UMI counts can
be expressed as the product of a negative binomial distribution for the total
counts and a Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution for the normalized expression
proportions. A key result from that derivation is that normalized expression
proportions $\underline{\rho} = (\rho_1, \rho_2, \ldots, \rho_G)$ follow a
Dirichlet distribution conditioned on the dispersion parameters $\underline{r}$,

$$
\underline{\rho} \mid \underline{r} \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\underline{r}).
$${#eq-norm-dirichlet-conditional}

When performing Bayesian inference on this model, we obtain a posterior
distribution over the parameters $\pi(\underline{r}, \hat{p} \mid
\underline{\underline{U}})$, where $\underline{\underline{U}}$ represents the
observed UMI count matrix. In this section, we address a fundamental question:
how do we characterize the distribution of normalized expression proportions
$\underline{\rho}$ when accounting for posterior uncertainty in $\underline{r}$?

## Posterior Predictive Distribution of Normalized Expression

### The posterior over $\underline{r}$ induces correlation in $\underline{\rho}$

After performing variational inference or MCMC sampling, we obtain samples from
the posterior distribution,

$$
\underline{r}^{(1)}, \underline{r}^{(2)}, \ldots, \underline{r}^{(S)} \sim 
\pi(\underline{r} \mid \underline{\underline{U}}).
$${#eq-norm-posterior-samples}

For each posterior sample $s$, we can draw normalized expression proportions
from the conditional Dirichlet distribution,

$$
\underline{\rho}^{(s)} \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\underline{r}^{(s)}).
$${#eq-norm-rho-samples}

The key observation is that the collection of samples
$\{\underline{\rho}^{(s)}\}_{s=1}^{S}$ exhibits correlation structure that is
absent when conditioning on a single value of $\underline{r}$. This correlation
arises from the variation in $\underline{r}$ across posterior samples. An
exception to this is when using variational inference with a full mean field
approximation, where the correlation structure is completely ignored.

To see this correlation structure mathematically, consider the variance of a
single component $\rho_g$ under the full posterior predictive distribution,

$$
\text{Var}(\rho_g) = 
\left\langle \text{Var}(\rho_g \mid \underline{r}) \right\rangle_{\underline{r}} 
+ \text{Var}_{\underline{r}}\left(\langle \rho_g \mid \underline{r} \rangle\right).
$${#eq-norm-variance-decomposition}

The first term represents the inherent variance of the Dirichlet distribution
for a fixed $\underline{r}$, while the second term captures the additional
variance induced by posterior uncertainty in $\underline{r}$. For the Dirichlet
distribution, we have

$$
\langle \rho_g \mid \underline{r} \rangle = \frac{r_g}{r_T}, \quad 
r_T = \sum_{j=1}^{G} r_j,
$${#eq-norm-dirichlet-mean}

and

$$
\text{Var}(\rho_g \mid \underline{r}) = \frac{r_g(r_T - r_g)}{r_T^2(r_T + 1)}.
$${#eq-norm-dirichlet-variance}

When $\underline{r}$ varies across posterior samples, the mean
$\langle \rho_g \mid \underline{r} \rangle$ also varies, contributing additional
variance through the second term in @eq-norm-variance-decomposition.

### Why not fit a single Dirichlet distribution?

A natural question arises: why not simply fit a single Dirichlet distribution to
the mean normalized expression $\bar{\underline{\rho}}$? Let us define

$$
\bar{\underline{\rho}} = \frac{1}{S} \sum_{s=1}^{S} \underline{\rho}^{(s)},
$${#eq-norm-mean-rho}

and attempt to find parameters $\bar{\underline{r}}$ such that

$$
\bar{\underline{\rho}} \approx \langle \text{Dirichlet}(\bar{\underline{r}}) \rangle.
$${#eq-norm-single-dirichlet}

While this approach captures the mean normalized expression, it fundamentally
fails to preserve the correlation structure. The covariance of a Dirichlet
distribution is given by

$$
\text{Cov}(\rho_g, \rho_h \mid \underline{r}) = \begin{cases}
\frac{r_g(r_T - r_g)}{r_T^2(r_T + 1)} & \text{if } g = h, \\
-\frac{r_g r_h}{r_T^2(r_T + 1)} & \text{if } g \neq h.
\end{cases}
$${#eq-norm-dirichlet-covariance}

This covariance structure is entirely determined by the parameters
$\underline{r}$ and does not account for the additional covariance induced by
posterior uncertainty. From @eq-norm-variance-decomposition, we see that 
fitting a single Dirichlet distribution captures only
$\left\langle \text{Var}(\rho_g \mid \underline{r}) 
\right\rangle_{\underline{r}}$ but completely misses 
$\text{Var}_{\underline{r}}(\langle \rho_g \mid \underline{r} \rangle)$.

Moreover, when the posterior over $\underline{r}$ exhibits correlation
structure—as is often the case with low-rank variational guides (see
@sec-reparam)—this correlation manifests in the covariance of
$\underline{\rho}$. A single Dirichlet distribution cannot capture such
inter-gene correlations beyond those imposed by the simplex constraint.

This motivates the need for a richer distributional family that can flexibly
model both the mean and covariance structure of normalized expression while
accounting for posterior uncertainty.

## Compositional Data and the Simplex

### The simplex constraint and its implications

Normalized expression proportions $\underline{\rho}$ are constrained to lie on
the unit simplex, defined as

$$
\Delta^{G-1} = \left\{\underline{\rho} \in \mathbb{R}^{G} : 
\rho_g \geq 0 \text{ for all } g, \sum_{g=1}^{G} \rho_g = 1\right\}.
$${#eq-norm-simplex-definition}

The simplex $\Delta^{G-1}$ is a $(G-1)$-dimensional manifold embedded in
$\mathbb{R}^{G}$. This geometric structure has profound implications for
statistical modeling. Standard multivariate distributions, such as the
multivariate Gaussian, are defined on unconstrained Euclidean space
$\mathbb{R}^{G}$ and cannot be directly applied to model data on the simplex.

The field of *compositional data analysis* provides a principled framework for
statistical inference on the simplex. The central insight is that compositional
data should be analyzed in an appropriate transformed space where standard
statistical tools apply, and then the results can be mapped back to the simplex.

### Transformations to Euclidean space

To work with distributions on the simplex, we require bijective transformations
that map between $\Delta^{G-1}$ and $\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$. Two prominent approaches
have emerged in the literature:

1. **Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) Transformation**: Maps the simplex to Euclidean
space by taking log-ratios relative to a reference component. This
transformation is bijective and has a well-defined Jacobian, allowing for proper
probability density calculations.

2. **Softmax Transformation**: Maps Euclidean space to the simplex via the
softmax function (popular in machine learning and related to the Boltzmann
distribution in statistical physics). While this transformation is surjective
(many-to-one), it provides a symmetric treatment of all components and is
particularly convenient for sampling.

In the following sections, we develop both approaches and explain their
complementary roles in modeling normalized gene expression.

## The Additive Log-Ratio (ALR) Transformation

### Definition and properties

The ALR transformation maps a point $\underline{\rho} \in \Delta^{G-1}$ to
coordinates $\underline{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{G-1}$ by taking log-ratios with
respect to a reference component. Without loss of generality, we choose the last
component as the reference and define

$$
z_i = \log(\rho_i) - \log(\rho_G), \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, G-1.
$${#eq-norm-alr-definition}

This transformation is bijective: given any $\underline{z} \in
\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$, we can uniquely recover $\underline{\rho} \in \Delta^{G-1}$.
To see this, we first observe that @eq-norm-alr-definition implies

$$
\rho_i = \rho_G \exp(z_i), \quad i = 1, 2, \ldots, G-1.
$${#eq-norm-alr-rho-relation}

Using the simplex constraint $\sum_{g=1}^{G} \rho_g = 1$, we have

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{G-1} \rho_G \exp(z_i) + \rho_G = 1,
$${#eq-norm-alr-sum-constraint}

which gives

$$
\rho_G = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{G-1} \exp(z_i)}.
$${#eq-norm-alr-rho-G}

Substituting back into @eq-norm-alr-rho-relation yields

$$
\rho_i = \frac{\exp(z_i)}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{G-1} \exp(z_j)}, \quad 
i = 1, 2, \ldots, G-1.
$${#eq-norm-alr-rho-i}

This defines the inverse ALR transformation, which we denote as
$\text{ALR}^{-1}: \mathbb{R}^{G-1} \rightarrow \Delta^{G-1}$.

### Matrix representation and computational considerations

The ALR transformation can be expressed in matrix form. Define the
transformation matrix $\underline{\underline{A}} \in \mathbb{R}^{(G-1) \times
G}$ as

$$
A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } i = j, \\
-1 & \text{if } j = G, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$${#eq-norm-alr-matrix-definition}

Then the ALR transformation can be written as

$$
\underline{z} = \underline{\underline{A}} \log(\underline{\rho}),
$${#eq-norm-alr-matrix-form}

where $\log(\underline{\rho})$ denotes element-wise logarithm.

For single-cell transcriptomics datasets with $G \approx 30{,}000$ genes,
materializing the matrix $\underline{\underline{A}}$ would require storing $G
\times (G-1) \approx 900{,}000{,}000$ entries. At 32-bit floating point
precision, this amounts to approximately 3.4 GB of memory—a prohibitive cost for
a simple transformation.

Fortunately, we can compute the ALR transformation directly from its definition
without materializing $\underline{\underline{A}}$. From @eq-norm-alr-definition,
we compute

$$
z_i = \log(\rho_i) - \log(\rho_G)
$${#eq-norm-alr-direct-computation}

for each $i = 1, \ldots, G-1$. This requires only $O(G)$ operations and $O(G)$
memory, compared to $O(G^2)$ for the matrix-based approach. This computational
consideration is crucial for scalability to high-dimensional gene expression
data.

### Jacobian of the ALR transformation

To define probability distributions on the simplex via the ALR transformation,
we must account for the change of variables. Consider a distribution
$\pi(\underline{z})$ defined on $\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$. The induced distribution on
$\Delta^{G-1}$ is given by

$$
\pi(\underline{\rho}) = \pi(\underline{z}) 
\left|\det\left(\frac{\partial \underline{z}}{\partial \underline{\rho}}\right)\right|,
$${#eq-norm-change-of-variables}

where $\frac{\partial \underline{z}}{\partial \underline{\rho}}$ is the Jacobian
matrix of the transformation.

To compute this Jacobian correctly, we must recognize that the simplex
constraint makes only $G-1$ components independent. We parameterize the simplex
with the $G-1$ free components $(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_{G-1})$ and set $\rho_G = 1
- \sum_{j=1}^{G-1}\rho_j$. The ALR coordinates are $z_i = \log(\rho_i) -
\log(\rho_G)$ for $i=1,\ldots,G-1$. 

By direct differentiation, accounting for the dependence of $\rho_G$ on the free
components,

$$
\frac{\partial z_i}{\partial \rho_j}
= \frac{\partial}{\partial \rho_j}\big(\log\rho_i - \log\rho_G\big)
= \frac{\delta_{ij}}{\rho_i} + \frac{1}{\rho_G},
\qquad i,j=1,\ldots,G-1.
$${#eq-norm-jacobian-entries}

In matrix form, letting $\mathbf{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$ be the all-ones vector,

$$
\underline{\underline{J}}
= \frac{\partial\,\underline{z}}{\partial(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_{G-1})}
= \operatorname{diag}\!\left(\frac{1}{\rho_1},\ldots,\frac{1}{\rho_{G-1}}\right)
\;+\; \frac{1}{\rho_G}\,\mathbf{1}\mathbf{1}^\top.
$${#eq-norm-jacobian-matrix}

This is a $(G-1)\times(G-1)$ matrix, as required for computing a determinant.
The key is to treat only the $G-1$ free simplex components as independent
variables, rather than all $G$ components, which would yield a non-square
Jacobian matrix.

Using the matrix determinant lemma $\det(\underline{\underline{D}} +
\alpha\,\mathbf{u}\mathbf{v}^\top) =
\det(\underline{\underline{D}})(1+\alpha\,\mathbf{v}^\top\underline{\underline{D}}^{-1}\mathbf{u})$
with $\underline{\underline{D}}=\operatorname{diag}(1/\rho_i)$,
$\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{v}=\mathbf{1}$, and $\alpha=1/\rho_G$, we obtain

$$
\begin{aligned}
\det(\underline{\underline{J}})
&= \det(\underline{\underline{D}})\,\left(1+\alpha\,\mathbf{1}^\top \underline{\underline{D}}^{-1}\mathbf{1}\right) \\
&= \left(\prod_{i=1}^{G-1}\frac{1}{\rho_i}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{\rho_G}\sum_{i=1}^{G-1}\rho_i\right) \\
&= \left(\prod_{i=1}^{G-1}\frac{1}{\rho_i}\right)\left(1+\frac{1-\rho_G}{\rho_G}\right) \\
&= \left(\prod_{i=1}^{G-1}\frac{1}{\rho_i}\right)\frac{1}{\rho_G} \\
&= \frac{1}{\prod_{g=1}^{G}\rho_g}.
\end{aligned}
$${#eq-norm-jacobian-result-intermediate}

Hence, the absolute Jacobian determinant for the ALR change of variables is

$$
\left|\det\!\left(\frac{\partial \underline{z}}{\partial (\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_{G-1})}\right)\right|
= \frac{1}{\prod_{g=1}^{G} \rho_g}
= \frac{1}{\rho_G\,\prod_{i=1}^{G-1}\rho_i}.
$${#eq-norm-jacobian-final}

For practical purposes, the key result is that the Jacobian determinant depends
only on the $\rho_i$ values themselves.

### Inverse ALR transformation

Given ALR coordinates $\underline{z} \in \mathbb{R}^{G-1}$, we recover the
simplex point $\underline{\rho}$ through the inverse transformation. From
@eq-norm-alr-rho-G and @eq-norm-alr-rho-i, we have the explicit formulas

$$
\rho_G = \frac{1}{1 + \sum_{i=1}^{G-1} \exp(z_i)},
$${#eq-norm-inverse-alr-rhoG}

$$
\rho_i = \frac{\exp(z_i)}{1 + \sum_{j=1}^{G-1} \exp(z_j)}, \quad 
i = 1, \ldots, G-1.
$${#eq-norm-inverse-alr-rhoi}

Equivalently, we can embed $\underline{z}$ into $\mathbb{R}^{G}$ by appending a
zero component,

$$
\underline{w} = (\underline{z}, 0) = (z_1, z_2, \ldots, z_{G-1}, 0),
$${#eq-norm-embed-z}

and apply the softmax function,

$$
\rho_g = \frac{\exp(w_g)}{\sum_{j=1}^{G} \exp(w_j)}, \quad g = 1, \ldots, G.
$${#eq-norm-inverse-alr-softmax}

Since $w_G = 0$, we have $\exp(w_G) = 1$, and the denominator becomes $1 +
\sum_{i=1}^{G-1} \exp(z_i)$, matching @eq-norm-inverse-alr-rhoG and
@eq-norm-inverse-alr-rhoi.

This observation connects the ALR transformation to the more familiar softmax
function, which we explore in the next section.

## The Logistic-Normal Distribution

### Definition via ALR transformation

The logistic-normal distribution is defined by applying the inverse ALR
transformation to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Let $\underline{z} \in
\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$ follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution,

$$
\underline{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(\underline{\mu}, \underline{\underline{\Sigma}}),
$${#eq-norm-z-gaussian}

where $\underline{\mu} \in \mathbb{R}^{G-1}$ is the mean vector and
$\underline{\underline{\Sigma}} \in \mathbb{R}^{(G-1) \times (G-1)}$ is the
covariance matrix. Then $\underline{\rho} = \text{ALR}^{-1}(\underline{z})$
follows a logistic-normal distribution on $\Delta^{G-1}$.

The probability density function of $\underline{\rho}$ is obtained via the
change of variables formula @eq-norm-change-of-variables,

$$
\pi(\underline{\rho}) = 
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{(G-1)/2} |\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}|^{1/2}} 
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\underline{z} - \underline{\mu})^{\top} 
\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}^{-1} (\underline{z} - \underline{\mu})\right) 
\left|\det\left(\frac{\partial \underline{z}}{\partial \underline{\rho}}\right)\right|,
$${#eq-norm-logistic-normal-density-prelim}

where $\underline{z}$ is related to $\underline{\rho}$ through
@eq-norm-alr-definition. Substituting the Jacobian from @eq-norm-jacobian-final,
we obtain

$$
\pi(\underline{\rho}) = 
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{(G-1)/2} |\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}|^{1/2} 
\prod_{g=1}^{G} \rho_g} 
\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(\underline{z} - \underline{\mu})^{\top} 
\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}^{-1} (\underline{z} - \underline{\mu})\right),
$${#eq-norm-logistic-normal-density}

where $z_i = \log(\rho_i) - \log(\rho_G)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, G-1$.

### Relationship to the Dirichlet distribution

The logistic-normal distribution serves as a flexible approximation to the
Dirichlet distribution. While the Dirichlet distribution is the natural choice
for modeling compositional data when conjugacy with the multinomial is desired,
it has limited flexibility in modeling covariance structure. Specifically, the
covariance between components in a Dirichlet distribution is entirely determined
by the concentration parameters through @eq-norm-dirichlet-covariance, which
imposes negative correlations between all pairs of components.

The logistic-normal distribution, in contrast, allows for arbitrary covariance
structure through the choice of $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$. This
flexibility makes it particularly suitable for capturing the complex correlation
patterns that arise from posterior uncertainty in $\underline{r}$.

For moderate to large concentration parameters, the Dirichlet distribution can
be well-approximated by a logistic-normal distribution through moment matching.
Given a Dirichlet distribution with parameters $\underline{r}$, we can choose
$\underline{\mu}$ and $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$ to match the first two
moments. The mean of $\rho_g$ under Dirichlet$(\underline{r})$ is given by
@eq-norm-dirichlet-mean. To match this mean, we set the logistic-normal
parameters such that

$$
\langle \rho_g \rangle = \frac{r_g}{r_T}.
$${#eq-norm-moment-match-mean}

For the covariance, we match @eq-norm-dirichlet-covariance. This moment matching
procedure provides a principled way to approximate a Dirichlet
distribution with a logistic-normal, though exact matching of all moments is
generally not possible due to the different parametric families.

### Asymmetry of the ALR transformation

A notable property of the ALR-based logistic-normal distribution is its
dependence on the choice of reference component. Different choices of reference
lead to different distributions on the simplex. For example, if we had chosen
component 1 as the reference instead of component $G$, the ALR coordinates would
be

$$
z_i' = \log(\rho_i) - \log(\rho_1), \quad i = 2, 3, \ldots, G,
$${#eq-norm-alr-alternative-reference}

and the resulting logistic-normal distribution would differ from that defined by
@eq-norm-alr-definition.

This asymmetry is both a limitation and a feature. It is a limitation in that
the choice of reference component must be made somewhat arbitrarily, and
different choices lead to different results. However, it is also a feature in
that the asymmetry allows for proper probability density calculations, as we
have shown. For applications requiring likelihood evaluation or Bayesian
inference, this property is essential.

For applications where symmetry is desired—such as sampling or
visualization—alternative transformations that treat all components equally are
preferable, as we discuss in the next section.

## The Softmax-Normal Distribution

### Definition and symmetric treatment

An alternative approach to modeling distributions on the simplex is through the
softmax transformation. Rather than working in $\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$, we consider
unconstrained vectors $\underline{w} \in \mathbb{R}^{G}$ and map them to the
simplex via

$$
\rho_g = \frac{\exp(w_g)}{\sum_{j=1}^{G} \exp(w_j)}, \quad g = 1, \ldots, G.
$${#eq-norm-softmax-definition}

This is known as the softmax or normalized exponential transformation.

If we let $\underline{w} \sim \mathcal{N}(\underline{\mu},
\underline{\underline{\Sigma}})$ where $\underline{\mu} \in \mathbb{R}^{G}$ and
$\underline{\underline{\Sigma}} \in \mathbb{R}^{G \times G}$, then
$\underline{\rho}$ defined by @eq-norm-softmax-definition follows what we term a
*softmax-normal distribution*.

The key advantage of this approach is symmetry: all components $\rho_g$ are
treated identically through the transformation. There is no distinguished
reference component, making this representation natural for many applications.

### Singular nature of the softmax transformation

Despite its appealing symmetry, the softmax transformation has a fundamental
limitation: it is not injective (one-to-one). Specifically, for any constant $c
\in \mathbb{R}$, we have

$$
\frac{\exp(w_g + c)}{\sum_{j=1}^{G} \exp(w_j + c)} = 
\frac{\exp(w_g) \exp(c)}{\sum_{j=1}^{G} \exp(w_j) \exp(c)} = 
\frac{\exp(w_g)}{\sum_{j=1}^{G} \exp(w_j)}.
$${#eq-norm-softmax-invariance}

This means that $\underline{w}$ and $\underline{w} + c\underline{1}$ (where
$\underline{1} = (1, 1, \ldots, 1)^{\top}$) map to the same point
$\underline{\rho}$ on the simplex. The transformation is invariant to
translations along the direction $\underline{1}$.

This invariance has profound implications for defining probability densities. To
compute $\pi(\underline{\rho})$ from $\pi(\underline{w})$, we would need to use
the change of variables formula,

$$
\pi(\underline{\rho}) = \pi(\underline{w}) 
\left|\det\left(\frac{\partial \underline{w}}{\partial \underline{\rho}}\right)\right|^{-1}.
$${#eq-norm-softmax-change-of-variables}

However, because the softmax transformation is many-to-one, the inverse
transformation $\underline{\rho} \mapsto \underline{w}$ is not uniquely defined.
Consequently, the Jacobian matrix $\frac{\partial \underline{w}}{\partial
\underline{\rho}}$ does not exist in the classical sense.

We can examine this more rigorously by computing the Jacobian of the forward
transformation. From @eq-norm-softmax-definition, we have

$$
\frac{\partial \rho_g}{\partial w_h} = \begin{cases}
\rho_g(1 - \rho_g) & \text{if } g = h, \\
-\rho_g \rho_h & \text{if } g \neq h.
\end{cases}
$${#eq-norm-softmax-jacobian-entry}

The Jacobian matrix $\underline{\underline{J}}_{\text{softmax}} = \frac{\partial
\underline{\rho}}{\partial \underline{w}}$ is thus

$$
\underline{\underline{J}}_{\text{softmax}} = 
\text{diag}(\underline{\rho}) - \underline{\rho}\underline{\rho}^{\top},
$${#eq-norm-softmax-jacobian}

where $\text{diag}(\underline{\rho})$ is a diagonal matrix with entries
$\rho_g$. This is a $(G \times G)$ matrix of rank at most $G-1$ because
$\sum_{g=1}^{G} \rho_g = 1$ imposes a linear constraint. Specifically, all rows
sum to zero, so the matrix is singular and

$$
\det(\underline{\underline{J}}_{\text{softmax}}) = 0.
$${#eq-norm-softmax-jacobian-determinant}

This confirms that a unique probability density cannot be assigned to points on
the simplex when using the softmax transformation with a distribution on
$\mathbb{R}^{G}$.

### Use cases for softmax-normal distributions

Despite the inability to evaluate probability densities, softmax-normal
distributions are highly useful for several purposes:

1. **Sampling**: Given parameters $\underline{\mu}$ and
$\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$, we can easily generate samples
$\underline{\rho}$ by first sampling $\underline{w} \sim
\mathcal{N}(\underline{\mu}, \underline{\underline{\Sigma}})$ and then applying
the softmax transformation @eq-norm-softmax-definition. This is computationally
efficient and avoids the asymmetry of the ALR approach.

2. **Visualization**: When visualizing distributions on the simplex (e.g.,
through ternary plots for $G=3$ or through principal component projections for
larger $G$), the symmetry of the softmax-normal representation provides a
natural and unbiased view.

3. **Posterior predictive sampling**: In applications where we only need to
generate samples from the posterior predictive distribution of normalized
expression, rather than evaluate likelihoods, the softmax-normal distribution
suffices.

For applications requiring likelihood evaluation—such as computing evidence
lower bounds in variational inference or performing hypothesis testing—the
ALR-based logistic-normal distribution must be used instead.

## Low-Rank Covariance Approximation

### Computational challenges in high dimensions

For single-cell RNA-seq datasets with $G \approx 30{,}000$ genes, the covariance
matrix $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$ in @eq-norm-z-gaussian is a $(G-1)
\times (G-1)$ matrix containing approximately $(G-1)^2 \approx 900{,}000{,}000$
parameters. Storing such a matrix at 32-bit floating point precision requires
approximately 3.6 GB of memory. Moreover, operations on this matrix—such as
computing $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}^{-1}$ or evaluating the probability
density @eq-norm-logistic-normal-density—have computational complexity $O(G^3)$,
which is prohibitive for $G \approx 30{,}000$.

Furthermore, estimating a full covariance matrix from data requires at least $G$
samples to be identifiable, and many more to be reliably estimated. In typical
posterior inference, we may have hundreds to thousands of posterior samples—far
fewer than would be needed to reliably estimate all $G^2$ parameters.

These considerations motivate a low-rank approximation to the covariance
structure.

### Low-rank plus diagonal parameterization

We parameterize the covariance matrix as

$$
\underline{\underline{\Sigma}} = 
\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top} + 
\underline{\underline{D}},
$${#eq-norm-low-rank-structure}

where $\underline{\underline{W}} \in \mathbb{R}^{(G-1) \times k}$ is a factor
loading matrix with $k \ll G-1$, and $\underline{\underline{D}} =
\text{diag}(\underline{d})$ is a diagonal matrix with $\underline{d} \in
\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$. This is known as the *low-rank plus diagonal* structure.

The low-rank component
$\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top}$ captures the
dominant correlation structure among genes, while the diagonal component
$\underline{\underline{D}}$ accounts for gene-specific variance. The total
number of parameters is $k(G-1) + (G-1) = (k+1)(G-1)$, which for $k = 50$ and $G
= 30{,}000$ gives approximately 1.5 million parameters—nearly three orders of
magnitude fewer than the full covariance matrix.

The computational benefits are substantial. Matrix-vector products
$\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}\underline{v}$ can be computed in $O(kG)$ time
rather than $O(G^2)$. Sampling from $\mathcal{N}(\underline{\mu},
\underline{\underline{\Sigma}})$ can be performed efficiently using the
representation

$$
\underline{z} = \underline{\mu} + 
\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\varepsilon}_w 
+ \sqrt{\underline{d}} \odot \underline{\varepsilon}_d,
$${#eq-norm-low-rank-sampling}

where $\underline{\varepsilon}_w \sim \mathcal{N}(\underline{0},
\underline{\underline{I}}_k)$, $\underline{\varepsilon}_d \sim
\mathcal{N}(\underline{0}, \underline{\underline{I}}_{G-1})$, and $\odot$
denotes element-wise multiplication. This requires only $O(kG)$ operations.

For density evaluation, the matrix determinant lemma gives

$$
|\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}| = |\underline{\underline{D}}| \cdot |\underline{\underline{I}}_k + \underline{\underline{W}}^{\top}
\underline{\underline{D}}^{-1}\underline{\underline{W}}|,
$${#eq-norm-low-rank-determinant}

which can be computed in $O(k^2 G)$ time since $|\underline{\underline{D}}| =
\prod_i d_i$ and the second term involves a $k \times k$ matrix.

### SVD-based parameter estimation

Given $N$ samples $\{\underline{z}^{(n)}\}_{n=1}^{N}$ in $\mathbb{R}^{G-1}$, we
wish to estimate the parameters $\underline{\mu}$, $\underline{\underline{W}}$,
and $\underline{d}$ in the low-rank model. The mean is simply

$$
\hat{\underline{\mu}} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \underline{z}^{(n)}.
$${#eq-norm-mean-estimate}

For the covariance, the standard approach would compute the sample covariance
matrix

$$
\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}} = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N} 
(\underline{z}^{(n)} - \hat{\underline{\mu}})
(\underline{z}^{(n)} - \hat{\underline{\mu}})^{\top},
$${#eq-norm-covariance-estimate}

and then perform an eigendecomposition to obtain the low-rank approximation.
However, forming $\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}}$ requires $O(NG^2)$
operations and $O(G^2)$ memory—both prohibitive for $G \approx 30{,}000$.

A more efficient approach leverages the singular value decomposition (SVD)
directly on the centered data matrix. Define

$$
\underline{\underline{X}} = \begin{bmatrix}
(\underline{z}^{(1)} - \hat{\underline{\mu}})^{\top} \\
(\underline{z}^{(2)} - \hat{\underline{\mu}})^{\top} \\
\vdots \\
(\underline{z}^{(N)} - \hat{\underline{\mu}})^{\top}
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times (G-1)},
$${#eq-norm-centered-data-matrix}

so that the $n$-th row of $\underline{\underline{X}}$ is the $n$-th centered 
sample. Then

$$
\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}} = 
\frac{1}{N-1} \underline{\underline{X}}^{\top}\underline{\underline{X}}.
$${#eq-norm-covariance-via-data-matrix}

The SVD of $\underline{\underline{X}}$ is

$$
\underline{\underline{X}} = 
\underline{\underline{U}}\;
\underline{\underline{S}}\;
\underline{\underline{V}}^{\top},
$${#eq-norm-svd-decomposition}

where $\underline{\underline{U}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times m}$ has orthonormal
columns, $\underline{\underline{S}} \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is diagonal
with non-negative entries $s_1 \geq s_2 \geq \cdots \geq s_m \geq 0$,
$\underline{\underline{V}} \in \mathbb{R}^{(G-1) \times m}$ has orthonormal
columns, and $m = \min(N, G-1)$. For typical single-cell applications with $N
\approx 1{,}500$ and $G \approx 30{,}000$, we have $m = N \ll G-1$.

Substituting @eq-norm-svd-decomposition into 
@eq-norm-covariance-via-data-matrix yields

$$
\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}} = \frac{1}{N-1} 
\underline{\underline{V}}\;\underline{\underline{S}}^{\top}\;
\underline{\underline{U}}^{\top}\underline{\underline{U}}\;
\underline{\underline{S}}\;\underline{\underline{V}}^{\top} = 
\frac{1}{N-1} \underline{\underline{V}}\;\underline{\underline{S}}^2\;
\underline{\underline{V}}^{\top},
$${#eq-norm-covariance-svd-form}

where we used the orthonormality
$\underline{\underline{U}}^{\top}\underline{\underline{U}} =
\underline{\underline{I}}_m$.

This shows that the eigenvalues of $\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}}$ are

$$
\lambda_i = \frac{s_i^2}{N-1}, \quad i = 1, \ldots, m,
$${#eq-norm-eigenvalues-from-svd}

and the corresponding eigenvectors are the columns of
$\underline{\underline{V}}$. Crucially, we obtain these eigenvalues and
eigenvectors without ever forming the $(G-1) \times (G-1)$ matrix
$\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}}$.

For the low-rank approximation with rank $k \leq m$, we take the top $k$
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Let $\underline{\underline{V}}_k$ denote the first
$k$ columns of $\underline{\underline{V}}$ and $\underline{s}_k = (s_1, \ldots,
s_k)$ the first $k$ singular values. Then

$$
\underline{\underline{W}} = \underline{\underline{V}}_k 
\operatorname{diag}\left(\frac{\underline{s}_k}{\sqrt{N-1}}\right) = 
\underline{\underline{V}}_k 
\operatorname{diag}\left(\sqrt{\underline{\lambda}_k}\right),
$${#eq-norm-W-from-svd}

where $\underline{\lambda}_k = (\lambda_1, \ldots, \lambda_k)$.

For the diagonal component, we use the residual variance—the average of the
discarded eigenvalues,

$$
d_i = \frac{1}{m-k} \sum_{j=k+1}^{m} \lambda_j + \epsilon, \quad 
i = 1, \ldots, G-1,
$${#eq-norm-diagonal-residual}

where $\epsilon > 0$ is a small constant (e.g., $10^{-6}$) for numerical
stability. This assumes that the residual variance is approximately isotropic—a
reasonable assumption given that we have already captured the dominant
anisotropic structure in the low-rank component.

### Memory and computational advantages

The SVD approach provides significant memory and computational savings when $N
\ll G$. Computing the SVD of the $N \times (G-1)$ matrix
$\underline{\underline{X}}$ requires $O(NG \min(N, G))$ operations. For $N \sim
1{,}000$ and $G \sim 30{,}000$, this is $O(NG \cdot N) = O(N^2 G) \approx 3
\times 10^{10}$ operations. In contrast, forming the covariance matrix via
@eq-norm-covariance-estimate would require $O(N G^2) \approx 10^{12}$
operations—about 100 times more expensive.

The memory requirements are even more dramatic. The SVD stores three matrices:
$\underline{\underline{U}}$ ($N \times N$), $\underline{S}$ ($N \times N$), and
$\underline{\underline{V}}^{\top}$ ($N \times G$), totaling approximately $N^2 +
NG$ floating point numbers. For $N \sim 1{,}000$ and $G \sim 30{,}000$, this is
roughly $3 \times 10^ 7$ numbers or 100 MB at 32-bit precision. The covariance
matrix $\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}}$ would require $G^2 \approx 900$
million numbers or roughly 4 GB.

These computational considerations make the SVD-based approach essential for
scalability to high-dimensional gene expression data.

### Variance explained and model selection

The proportion of variance explained by the rank-$k$ approximation is

$$
\text{EVR}(k) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} \lambda_i}{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i},
$${#eq-norm-variance-explained}

where EVR stands for "explained variance ratio." This quantity provides guidance
for choosing the rank $k$.

In the context of gene expression data, the interpretation of EVR requires care.
A low EVR (e.g., 10-20%) for modest $k$ (e.g., $k = 50$) does not necessarily
indicate a poor approximation. Rather, it reflects the genuinely
high-dimensional nature of gene expression space after the nonlinear
transformations from the original Dirichlet sampling.

Specifically, even though the posterior over $\underline{r}$ may exhibit
low-rank structure (e.g., from a low-rank variational guide), the composition of
two nonlinear transformations—Dirichlet sampling followed by log-ratio
transformation—can "unfold" this low-rank structure into many dimensions. The
rank-$k$ approximation captures the $k$ most prominent directions of variation,
which often correspond to biologically meaningful gene modules or expression
programs.

## Complete Fitting Procedure

### Algorithm overview

We now describe the complete procedure for fitting a low-rank logistic-normal
distribution to posterior samples of normalized expression. The algorithm
consists of the following steps:

1. **Generate posterior samples**: From posterior inference, obtain $S$ samples
of the dispersion parameters $\{\underline{r}^{(s)}\}_{s=1}^{S}$.

2. **Sample from Dirichlet**: For each posterior sample $s$, draw normalized
proportions $\underline{\rho}^{(s)} \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\underline{r}^{(s)})$.

3. **Apply ALR transformation**: Transform each sample to ALR coordinates,
$$
z_i^{(s)} = \log(\rho_i^{(s)}) - \log(\rho_G^{(s)}), \quad 
i = 1, \ldots, G-1.
$${#eq-norm-alr-transform-step}

4. **Optional mean centering**: If desired, compute $\bar{\underline{z}} =
\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s=1}^{S} \underline{z}^{(s)}$ and center the samples,
$$
\tilde{\underline{z}}^{(s)} = \underline{z}^{(s)} - \bar{\underline{z}}.
$${#eq-norm-centering-step}

5. **Fit low-rank MVN**: Use the SVD-based procedure from the previous section
to estimate $\tilde{\underline{\mu}}$, $\underline{\underline{W}}$, and
$\underline{d}$ from the samples $\{\tilde{\underline{z}}^{(s)}\}$.

6. **Restore mean**: If centering was applied, set $\underline{\mu} =
\tilde{\underline{\mu}} + \bar{\underline{z}} = \bar{\underline{z}}$ (since
$\tilde{\underline{\mu}} = 0$ after centering).

7. **Create distributions**: Form both an ALR-based logistic-normal distribution
(for likelihood evaluation) and a softmax-normal distribution (for sampling).

### The centering option

The optional centering step in @eq-norm-centering-step serves to isolate
covariation patterns from the mean composition. When samples come from a
homogeneous cell population, the first principal component often captures the
dominant mean composition, with $\lambda_1 \gg \lambda_2$. The subsequent
components capture gene-gene correlations and cell-to-cell variability.

By centering the data before fitting the covariance structure, we ensure that
the low-rank approximation
$\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top}$ captures variation
*around* the mean rather than variation dominated by the mean itself.
Mathematically, fitting to centered data $\{\tilde{\underline{z}}^{(s)}\}$
yields a covariance matrix that represents

$$
\text{Cov}(\underline{z} - \bar{\underline{z}}) = 
\left\langle (\underline{z} - \bar{\underline{z}})
(\underline{z} - \bar{\underline{z}})^{\top} \right\rangle,
$${#eq-norm-centered-covariance}

which is identical to $\text{Cov}(\underline{z})$ but is estimated in a way that
prevents the mean from dominating the principal components.

The final distribution is

$$
\underline{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(\bar{\underline{z}}, 
\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top} 
+ \underline{\underline{D}}),
$${#eq-norm-final-centered-distribution}

which correctly models both the mean $\bar{\underline{z}}$ and the covariance
structure around that mean.

### Embedding ALR parameters for softmax-normal

To create a softmax-normal distribution from ALR parameters, we embed the
$(G-1)$-dimensional parameters into $G$ dimensions. Given ALR parameters
$\underline{\mu}_{\text{ALR}} \in \mathbb{R}^{G-1}$,
$\underline{\underline{W}}_{\text{ALR}} \in \mathbb{R}^{(G-1) \times k}$, and
$\underline{d}_{\text{ALR}} \in \mathbb{R}^{G-1}$, we construct

$$
\underline{\mu} = \begin{bmatrix} \underline{\mu}_{\text{ALR}} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, 
\quad
\underline{\underline{W}} = \begin{bmatrix} 
\underline{\underline{W}}_{\text{ALR}} \\ \underline{0}^{\top} \end{bmatrix}, 
\quad
\underline{d} = \begin{bmatrix} \underline{d}_{\text{ALR}} \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
$${#eq-norm-alr-to-softmax-embedding}

where the zeros correspond to the reference component.

This embedding is equivalent to setting the $G$-th component to zero in the
log-space representation. When we sample 

$$
\underline{w} \sim
\mathcal{N}(\underline{\mu},
\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top} +
\text{diag}(\underline{d}))
$$ {#eq-norm-softmax-normal-sampling}

and apply the softmax transformation
@eq-norm-softmax-definition, the resulting $\underline{\rho}$ has the same
distribution as if we had sampled 

$$
\underline{z} \sim
\mathcal{N}(\underline{\mu}_{\text{ALR}},
\underline{\underline{W}}_{\text{ALR}}
\underline{\underline{W}}_{\text{ALR}}^{\top}
+ \text{diag}(\underline{d}_{\text{ALR}})),
$$ {#eq-norm-softmax-normal-sampling-2}

and applied the inverse ALR transformation.

The key insight is that the softmax transformation is invariant to constant
shifts (see @eq-norm-softmax-invariance), so fixing the reference component to
have zero mean and zero variance does not restrict the distribution on the
simplex. The softmax normalization ensures that $\sum_{g=1}^{G} \rho_g = 1$
regardless of the parameters in $\underline{\mu}$ and
$\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$.

## Mathematical Justification

### Why logistic-normal approximates the Dirichlet

The logistic-normal distribution provides a flexible approximation to the
Dirichlet distribution through several mechanisms. First, for large
concentration parameters, the Dirichlet distribution becomes increasingly
concentrated and approximately Gaussian in appropriate coordinates.
Specifically, if $\underline{\rho} \sim \text{Dirichlet}(\alpha \underline{r})$
where $\alpha \to \infty$ and $\underline{r}$ is held fixed with $\sum r_g = 1$,
then the ALR coordinates $\underline{z}$ converge in distribution to a
multivariate Gaussian.

To see this heuristically, note that for large $\alpha$, the Dirichlet
concentrates near its mode. The mode of Dirichlet$(\underline{r})$ is

$$
\rho_g^* = \frac{r_g - 1}{r_T - G} \approx \frac{r_g}{r_T}
$${#eq-norm-dirichlet-mode}

for large $r_g$. Near the mode, a second-order Taylor expansion of the
log-density yields an approximately Gaussian distribution. When this Gaussian
approximation is transformed through the ALR mapping, it remains approximately
Gaussian.

Second, moment matching provides a practical method for approximating any
Dirichlet distribution with a logistic-normal. Given target moments
$\langle \rho_g \rangle$ and $\text{Cov}(\rho_g, \rho_h)$ from a Dirichlet
distribution, we can solve for logistic-normal parameters $\underline{\mu}$ and
$\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$ that approximately match these moments. While
exact moment matching for all moments is generally impossible (since the
Dirichlet and logistic-normal are different parametric families), matching the
first two moments often provides an adequate approximation for practical
purposes.

### Preservation of correlation structure

A key advantage of the logistic-normal approximation is its ability to capture
posterior-induced correlations that are absent in any single Dirichlet
distribution. Recall from @eq-norm-variance-decomposition that the total
variance decomposes as

$$
\text{Var}(\rho_g) = 
\underbrace{\left\langle \text{Var}(\rho_g \mid \underline{r}) 
\right\rangle_{\underline{r}}}_{\text{within-Dirichlet variance}} + 
\underbrace{\text{Var}_{\underline{r}}(\langle \rho_g \mid \underline{r} 
\rangle)}_{\text{between-sample variance}}.
$${#eq-norm-variance-decomposition-repeat}

A single Dirichlet distribution fitted to the mean $\bar{\underline{\rho}}$
captures only the first term. The logistic-normal, through its flexible
covariance structure $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$, can capture both terms.

Moreover, when the posterior over $\underline{r}$ exhibits correlation (as
induced by low-rank variational guides; see @sec-reparam), this correlation
propagates to $\underline{\rho}$ through @eq-norm-rho-samples. The
logistic-normal covariance $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$ can represent these
inter-gene correlations directly.

The low-rank structure $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}} =
\underline{\underline{W}}\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top} +
\underline{\underline{D}}$ further connects to the low-rank structure in
$\underline{r}$-space. If the posterior over $\underline{r}$ has low-rank
correlation structure (i.e., a few dominant principal components), this
structure approximately transfers to the ALR-transformed space through the chain

$$
\underline{r} \xrightarrow{\text{Dirichlet}} \underline{\rho} 
\xrightarrow{\text{ALR}} \underline{z}.
$${#eq-norm-transformation-chain}

While the Dirichlet sampling and ALR transformation are both nonlinear, the
low-rank structure is approximately preserved when the posterior over
$\underline{r}$ is sufficiently concentrated.

When centering is applied, the covariance structure captures variation in
$\underline{z}$ around its mean, which corresponds to variation in gene
expression patterns after removing the dominant mean composition. This is
particularly interpretable: the principal components of
$\underline{\underline{W}}\;\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top}$ represent the
dominant axes of variation in log-ratio space, often corresponding to
co-regulated gene modules or biological processes.

### Comparison to direct Dirichlet fitting

To make the comparison concrete, consider two approaches to approximating the
posterior predictive distribution:

**Approach 1 (Single Dirichlet)**: Compute the mean normalized expression
$\bar{\underline{\rho}}$ from @eq-norm-mean-rho and fit parameters
$\bar{\underline{r}}$ such that
$\langle \text{Dirichlet}(\bar{\underline{r}}) \rangle = 
\bar{\underline{\rho}}$.
From @eq-norm-dirichlet-mean, this gives $\bar{r}_g = \bar{r}_T \bar{\rho}_g$
for any choice of total concentration $\bar{r}_T$.

The expected value is

$$
\langle \rho_g \rangle = \frac{\bar{r}_g}{\bar{r}_T} = \bar{\rho}_g,
$${#eq-norm-single-dirichlet-mean}

which correctly matches the posterior mean. However, the covariance is

$$
\text{Cov}(\rho_g, \rho_h) = 
-\frac{\bar{r}_g \bar{r}_h}{\bar{r}_T^2(\bar{r}_T + 1)}
$${#eq-norm-single-dirichlet-cov}

for $g \neq h$, which depends only on $\bar{\underline{r}}$ and cannot capture
the additional covariance from posterior variation in $\underline{r}$.

**Approach 2 (Logistic-Normal)**: Fit a logistic-normal distribution with
parameters $\underline{\mu}$ and $\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}$ estimated from
samples $\{\underline{z}^{(s)}\}$ as described above. The resulting distribution
has

$$
\langle \underline{z} \rangle = \underline{\mu},
$${#eq-norm-logistic-normal-mean}

$$
\text{Cov}(\underline{z}) = \underline{\underline{\Sigma}} = 
\underline{\underline{W}}\underline{\underline{W}}^{\top} 
+ \underline{\underline{D}},
$${#eq-norm-logistic-normal-cov}

which directly captures the empirical covariance structure in ALR space. This
covariance accounts for both within-Dirichlet variation and between-sample
variation induced by the posterior over $\underline{r}$.

The difference is precisely captured by @eq-norm-variance-decomposition-repeat:
the logistic-normal captures the full variance $\text{Var}(\rho_g)$, while the
single Dirichlet captures only 
$\left\langle \text{Var}(\rho_g \mid \underline{r}) 
\right\rangle_{\underline{r}}$.

## Computational Considerations

The computational efficiency of our approach relies on several key algorithmic
choices. In this section, we quantify the memory and runtime advantages.

### Memory complexity

For datasets with $G \approx 30{,}000$ genes and $N \approx 1{,}500$ posterior
samples, the memory requirements for different approaches are:

| Operation                               | Full Covariance                        | Low-Rank ($k = 50$)      | Memory Ratio  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| Store covariance matrix                 | $(G-1)^2 \approx 900M$ floats = 3.6 GB |                          |               |
| $(k+1)(G-1) \approx 1.5M$ floats = 6 MB | 600:1                                  |                          |               |
| Compute covariance                      | $O(NG^2)$ operations                   |                          |               |
| $O(NG \min(N,G))$ operations            | 20:1                                   |                          |               |
| Sample                                  | $O(G^2)$ per sample                    | $O(kG)$ per sample       | $G/k = 600$:1 |
| Matrix inversion                        | $O(G^3)$ operations                    | Avoid inversion entirely | —             |

These dramatic savings make the low-rank approach essential for practical
application to high-dimensional gene expression data.

### ALR transformation without matrix materialization

As discussed in Section 4, the ALR transformation can be computed directly from
the definition @eq-norm-alr-definition without forming the transformation matrix
$\underline{\underline{A}}$. For $G = 30{,}000$ genes, this saves approximately
3.4 GB of memory.

The computational cost of the direct approach is

$$
\text{Cost}_{\text{direct}} = O(G) \quad \text{operations per sample},
$${#eq-norm-alr-direct-cost}

compared to

$$
\text{Cost}_{\text{matrix}} = O(G^2) \quad \text{operations per sample}
$${#eq-norm-alr-matrix-cost}

for the matrix-based approach. For $N$ samples, this gives a total savings of
$O(NG)$ operations, which is substantial for large $G$.

### SVD memory advantage

The SVD-based covariance estimation is particularly advantageous when $N \ll G$,
as is typical in our application. The SVD of an $N \times G$ matrix stores:

- Left singular vectors $\underline{\underline{U}}$: $N \times N$ matrix
- Singular values $\underline{S}$: $N$ values
- Right singular vectors $\underline{\underline{V}}^{\top}$: $N \times G$ matrix

Total memory: $N^2 + N + NG \approx N(N + G)$ floating point numbers.

For $N = 1{,}500$ and $G = 30{,}000$, this is approximately $1{,}500 \times
31{,}500 = 47.25$ million numbers or 180 MB at 32-bit precision.

In contrast, storing the full covariance matrix
$\hat{\underline{\underline{\Sigma}}}$ requires $G^2 = 900$ million numbers or
3.6 GB—a 20-fold reduction.

The computational cost comparison is similarly favorable. Computing the SVD
costs

$$
\text{Cost}_{\text{SVD}} = O(NG \min(N, G)) = O(N^2 G)
$${#eq-norm-svd-cost}

operations, while forming the covariance matrix and computing its
eigendecomposition costs

$$
\text{Cost}_{\text{eigh}} = O(NG^2) + O(G^3).
$${#eq-norm-eigh-cost}

For $N = 1{,}500$ and $G = 30{,}000$, we have

$$
\text{Cost}_{\text{SVD}} = O(1{,}500^2 \times 30{,}000) = O(67.5 \times 10^9),
$${#eq-norm-svd-cost-numerical}

$$
\text{Cost}_{\text{eigh}} = O(1{,}500 \times 30{,}000^2) + O(30{,}000^3) 
= O(1.35 \times 10^{12}) + O(2.7 \times 10^{13}),
$${#eq-norm-eigh-cost-numerical}

showing that the SVD approach is approximately 400 times faster.

These computational advantages make the SVD-based approach not merely convenient
but essential for scalability to realistic single-cell datasets.
