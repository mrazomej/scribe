## Reparameterization for Variational Inference Guides {#sec-reparam}

In the @sec-vi_primer, we introduced the core principles of variational
inference, culminating in the formulation of the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) as
a tractable objective for approximating posterior distributions. A central
assumption in the simplest form of variational inference, known as the
**mean-field approximation**, is that the variational distribution
$q_\phi(\underline{\theta})$ factorizes into independent components for each
parameter,

$$
q_\phi(\underline{\theta}) = \prod_{i=1}^K q_{\phi_i}(\theta_i).
$${#eq-reparam_mean_field}

This assumption simplifies the optimization problem considerably. However, it
fails to capture any correlation structure that may exist in the true posterior
distribution $\pi(\underline{\theta} \mid \underline{x})$. When parameters in
the true posterior are highly correlated, a factorized approximation provides a
poor fit, leading to inaccurate inference. This is precisely the challenge we
face with the Negative Binomial-Dirichlet Multinomial (NBDM) model.

### The Challenge of Correlated Parameters

The Negative Binomial distribution is characterized by a success probability
parameter $p$ and a dispersion parameter $r$. The mean of the distribution is
given by $\mu = r(1-p)/p$, and the variance is $\sigma^2 = r(1-p)/p^2 = \mu/p$.
From these relationships, it is evident that $r$ and $p$ are not independent.
The shape of the posterior distribution often exhibits a strong "banana-shaped"
correlation between these parameters, as illustrated in @fig-SI_reparam. A
mean-field guide, which assumes independence, attempts to fit a rectangular
region to this curved geometry. This results in an approximation that either
covers large areas of low probability or misses significant portions of the true
posterior mass.

![**Posterior Geometry and Variational Approximation.** Conceptual illustration
of the challenges in fitting a factorized variational distribution to a
correlated posterior. The true posterior (blue) for the Negative Binomial
parameters $(r, p)$ exhibits a characteristic curved shape. A mean-field guide
(red rectangle) fails to capture this correlation, leading to a poor
approximation. Reparameterizing in terms of mean and dispersion $(\mu, r)$ can
result in a more separable geometry (green), allowing for a better
fit.](./fig/supplementary/figSI_reparam_motivation){#fig-SI_reparam}

### Linked Parameterization: Mean and Probability

To address this limitation, we can reparameterize the model to reduce the
correlation in the guide's parameter space. One intuitive approach is to define
the variational distribution in terms of the mean $\mu$ and the success
probability $p$. In this "*linked*" parameterization, we treat $\mu$ and $p$ as
independent random variables in our guide and define $r$ as a deterministic
function of them.

Given the mean expression $\mu = r(1-p)/p$, we can express $r$ as

$$
r = \frac{\mu p}{1-p}.
$${#eq-reparam_linked_r}

The variational guide now becomes a factorized distribution over $\mu$ and $p$,

$$
q(\mu, p) = q(\mu)q(p).
$${#eq-reparam_linked_guide}

This reparameterization explicitly encodes the mean-variance relationship of the
Negative Binomial distribution into the guide, allowing it to better capture the
posterior's geometry. However, this formulation introduces a potential for
numerical instability. As the success probability $p$ approaches 1, the
denominator $(1-p)$ approaches zero, which can lead to computational issues
during optimization.

### Odds-Ratio Parameterization: A More Stable Approach

To overcome the numerical challenges of the linked parameterization while still
capturing the parameter correlations, we introduce a third, more robust
parameterization based on the odds ratio. Instead of sampling $p$ directly from
a Beta distribution, which is constrained to the interval $[0, 1]$, we introduce
a new parameter $\phi$ from which $p$ can be derived. We define their
relationship as

$$
p = \frac{1}{1+\phi},
$${#eq-reparam_odds_p}

which implies that $\phi = (1-p)/p$. This quantity, $\phi$, represents the odds
of failure versus success. The advantage of this formulation is that while $p$
is constrained to $[0, 1]$, $\phi$ is a positive real number, $\phi \in [0,
\infty)$. We can therefore use flexible and unconstrained distributions like the
Log-Normal or Beta-Prime distribution for its prior and variational guide,
avoiding the boundary issues encountered with $p$.

We retain the gene-specific mean $\mu_g$ as an independent parameter in our
guide. The dispersion parameter $r_g$ is then defined deterministically as

$$
r_g = \mu_g \phi.
$${#eq-reparam_odds_r}

Let's verify this formulation. The mean of the Negative Binomial is $\mu_g =
r_g(1-p)/p$. Substituting our expression for $\phi$ gives $\mu_g = r_g \phi$.
This is inconsistent with our definition for $r_g$. Let's re-examine the
relationship. The mean of the negative binomial is $\mu = r(1-p)/p$. If we
define $\phi = (1-p)/p$, then $\mu = r \phi$. This implies that $r$ should be
defined as

$$
r_g = \frac{\mu_g}{\phi}.
$${#eq-reparam_odds_r_corrected}

This corrected "odds-ratio" parameterization, based on a factorized guide
$q(\mu, \phi) = q(\mu)q(\phi)$, provides a numerically stable and flexible
framework for approximating the complex posterior of the NBDM model, forming the
basis of the `odds_ratio` models used in this work.
