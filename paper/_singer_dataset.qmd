# Simple test dataset

Throughout the following sections, we will exemplify the mathematical and
practical aspects of the models presented in this paper using a simple test
dataset from @singer2014. This dataset emerges from a fundamental question in
stem cell biology: why do genetically identical embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
express the same genes at vastly different levels?

Singer and colleagues used single-molecule RNA-FISH to peer into individual
mouse ESCs and count mRNA molecules for key regulators like *Rex1* and *Nanog*
(core pluripotency factors that maintain stem cell identity), *Rest* (a
transcriptional repressor), and *Prdm14* (a pluripotency regulator controlling
DNA methylation). Rather than seeing uniform expression across cells, they
discovered striking heterogeneity - some cells had high mRNA counts while others
had low counts for the same genes.

The experimental approach was elegantly direct: fix ESCs in suspension,
hybridize fluorescent probes to specific mRNAs, image individual cells, and use
automated analysis to count transcripts. Across ~400 cells per sample and 36
ESC-related genes, this revealed distinct patterns---*Rex1* and *Nanog* showed
bimodal distributions suggesting two discrete cellular states, while genes like
*Prdm14* exhibited "long-tailed" distributions with rare bursts of high
expression.

This dataset serves as an exceptionally valuable testing ground for our models
for several reasons. First, it focuses on just four carefully chosen genes
rather than attempting to measure an entire transcriptome, allowing us to deeply
understand the behavior of each gene without the complexity of thousands of
measurements. Second, single-molecule FISH provides vastly more precise
transcript counts than single-cell RNA-seq---we can trust that a count of 50
mRNA molecules truly represents 50 molecules, not a noisy estimate influenced by
capture efficiency, amplification bias, or dropout events. This precision gives
us a clean "toy dataset" where we can test and clearly explain the fundamental
ideas behind the mixture models and state detection methods that we later apply
to noisier, higher-dimensional single-cell RNA-seq data.

@fig-SI_singer_hist and @fig-SI_singer_ecdf show the histograms and ECDFs of the
mRNA counts for the four genes in the @singer2014 dataset. Since our models work
directly with the mRNA counts, we do not bin the histograms, but rather plot all
the possible single counts. The ECDF becomes a useful tool to visualize as the
histograms have a lot of noise due to the low number of cells.
